<p> June 2, 2025</p>
    <p>The world always feels meaner after a long nap. I woke up about an hour ago and that sick-to-my-stomach feeling is more stubborn than usual. 
</p>
    <p>Told Christian I needed someone to force me to do my chores. He shows up a little before 8 with a photo book he got on his lunch break. We put on Streetwise. I get upset with him for sitting too close to me and tell him about a potential date later in the week. He says I should go. I give him some blankets and tell him he can crash on the couch again.

<p>Stayed in today. Texted Christian that I felt hungover. </p>
<p>I watched an interview of Tom Waits by Robert Lloyd from Anti Records at the Ambassador Hotel in 2002. It was for Alice and Blood Money. They went back and forth about the emus Tom Waits was raising for the “God’s Away on Business” video. Bob Dylan’s son Jesse directed the video and shot both album covers. Apparently three of the emus were eaten by coyotes before the shoot. He talked about New York being a home for artists because it constantly bombards you with surreal visual information. I should be more observant. And maybe stop inventorying my character traits.
</p>
<p>Called Marina and said I’d maybe stop by for a drink later.

<p> Marina and I stand in her bedroom and I ask if she ever feels like she's masquerading as a woman. <em>Oh all the time until I look in the mirror</em>. I tell her I see a little girl when I look in the mirror too. We ran late to the bar before meeting up with Abby. My knee stings from when I scraped it falling on the way out. I'm impatient with the cab driver, but I had this sharp pain in my side and forgot myself for a second. Anyway he seems like a nice man.
 </p>

  <p> My family and I were going to watch the Graduate before realizing we couldn’t work the hotel room TV. I think I saw it for the first time in high school. Then again for a film class in college. I catch myself humming to Simon & Garfunkel and realize I haven't been in high school for 7 years. And college for 4. It feels strange calling myself a lawyer now. For the first time I resonate with Dustin Hoffman. Mostly the part when he puts on the scuba suit and sinks six feet deep into the pool. I keep forgetting to email my advisor to start registering for my PhD courses.

    Saw Christian for the first time in five years. Suddenly I was 19 again. <em>You introduced me to Ultimate Spinach</em>. I hate to admit that to any boy. 
</p>
    
<p> Country Leaver comes on. They sound a lot like the Brian Jonestown Massacre in this album. They sold out but they were happier I guess. I tell him about the Brian Jonestown Massacre concert and say he should come. I’m not sure that I mean it. It's on the night before my 25th birthday.
</p>
    
<p> We picked a bar then sat and caught up. <em>If we were to call this a date</em>—I interrupt him: <em> We wouldn't</em>. </p>
