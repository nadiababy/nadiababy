<p> Marina and I stand in her bedroom and I ask if she ever feels like she's masquerading as a woman. <em> Oh all the time until I look in the mirror. </em> I tell her I see a little girl when I look in the mirror too. We ran late to the bar before meeting up with Abby. My knee stings from when I scraped it falling on the way out. I'm impatient with the cab driver, but I had this sharp pain in my side and forgot myself for a second. Anyway he seems like a nice man. </p>

  <p> When my family was here, we planned to watch the Graduate before realizing we couldnâ€™t work the hotel room TV. I think I watched it for the first time in high school. Then again for a film class in college. I catch myself humming to Simon & Garfunkel and realize I haven't been in high school for 7 years. And college for 4. It seems odd to call myself a lawyer when I still feel this little. For the first time I resonate with Dustin Hoffman while his mother lists his accolades. Six feet deep in a scuba suit waiting to start my PhD.
